platonic means in a moment. First lets cover where kaeya is from. Kaeya is from video game "Genshin Impact" and is one-- <br>
of the characters in the game. Genshin Impact was made by company miHoYo mostly spelled as "Mihoyo" or "mihoyo." now since-- <br>

is not sexual. <em>a love or friendship that is not sexual in anyway.</em>
